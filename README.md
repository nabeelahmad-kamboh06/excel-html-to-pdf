Ensures that the provided HTML text includes necessary styling for proper formatting when converted to a PDF. This function adds a default CSS style block to the HTML and wraps the content in a container with the class "page-safe" for better layout control.

    The function performs the following:
    1. Adds a `<style>` block with predefined CSS rules to the `<head>` section of the HTML.
       - If `<head>` is missing, it adds the `<head>` section within `<html>`.
    2. Wraps the content inside a `<div>` with the class "page-safe" for layout consistency.
       - Ensures that the "page-safe" class is applied only if it is not already present.

    Args:
      html_text (str): The input HTML text to be styled.

    Returns:
      str: The modified HTML text with the added styling and layout adjustments.

    Notes:
      - If the input HTML does not contain `<html>` or `<head>`, the function assumes
        the content is raw HTML and wraps it using a helper function `wrap_html_content`.
      - The added CSS ensures proper page breaks, font styling, and layout adjustments
        for PDF conversion.
